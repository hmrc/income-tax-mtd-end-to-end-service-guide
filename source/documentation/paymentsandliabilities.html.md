# Payments and Liabilities
 
The Self Assessment Account API allows a developer to retrieve accounting information to be shown back to the customer. This includes listing payments the customer has made, how these payments have been allocated and details of any upcoming or outstanding liabilities. 
The data returned only relates to payments and liabilities arising for tax years since the customer joined the new service. There may also be outstanding liabilities and payment information a customer needs to view for the years prior to signing up to Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment that can be viewed using their existing Personal Tax Account.

With these endpoints a developer can:

* retrieve the overall liability broken down into overdue, payable and pending amounts
* retrieve a list of crystallised charges and payments for a given date
range
* list self-assessment charges between two dates
* retrieve the history of changes to an individual charge
* retrieve a list of payments for a given date range
* retrieve the allocation details of a specific payment against one or more liabilities

## Coding Out Underpayments and Debt

Coding out is a concept used to collect underpaid tax and debts through a customerâ€™s PAYE tax code.

The coding out underpayments and debts endpoints allow software packages to overwrite coding out underpayment and debt amounts that are held by HMRC for a previous tax year and given NINO.

Software packages can then amend previously submitted overwrite amounts, retrieve the HMRC held or user submitted coding out amounts or delete the user submitted amounts.

Use these endpoints to create, amend, retrieve or delete a coding out amount:
