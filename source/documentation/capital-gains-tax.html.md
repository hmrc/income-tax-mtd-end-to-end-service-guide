# Capital Gains Tax

Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit when you sell or dispose of an asset that’s increased in value.

From the 6th April 2020, a user selling a residential property in the UK must report and pay Capital Gains Tax. This must be done within 30 days of the sale.

Our endpoints allow a user to create, delete or amend Capitals Gains Income.
