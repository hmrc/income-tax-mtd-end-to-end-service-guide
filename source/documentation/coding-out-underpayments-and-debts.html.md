# Coding Out Underpayments and Debts

Coding out is a concept used to collect underpaid tax and debts through a customerâ€™s PAYE tax code.

The coding out underpayments and debts endpoints allow software packages to overwrite coding out underpayment and debt amounts that are held by HMRC for a previous tax year and given NINO.

Software packages can then amend previously submitted overwrite amounts, retrieve the HMRC held or user submitted coding out amounts or delete the user submitted amounts.

Use these endpoints to create, amend, retrieve or delete a coding out amount:
