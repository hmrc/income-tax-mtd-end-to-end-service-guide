# Additional Income

## Submit information about personal income
### Self-assessment return

The software should prompt customers to make sure they have considered the following potential additional income sources (there are links to the APIs where the functionality is available, we will continue to release additional functionality and update this page).

* any income from [bank or building society interest](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/UK-Savings-Account) (supported in live)
* any income from [dividends](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Dividends-Income) (supported in live)  
*	any [gift aid contributions](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-reliefs-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Charitable-Givings) they have made (supported in live)  
*	any pension contributions
*	any pension income
*	capital gains
*	income from employment
*	additional information (currently provided on the SA101)
*	any income from partnerships
*	any income from trusts
*	any foreign income

**Note:**

Information currently provided through the existing self-assessment process: if a customer needs to report information to HMRC that is not yet supported under MTD or your software, they will need to complete a Self Assessment tax return.  Any information they have provided through MTD will not be considered and they will have to submit everything through the existing HMRC Self Assessment service.


## Employments

This suite of endpoints display the PAYE information returned to HMRC by a user’s employers.

The user will be able to add to or supply different employment data after the tax year has ended.  This can include details of missing employments, or financial data.  In addition, the user can choose to ignore the data HMRC holds, for the purpose of their self-assessment calculation.

These endpoints can be broken into three categories:

* [details of the employment](#employment-details)  
* [financial data and benefits from a specific employment](#financial-data-and-benefits)
* [employment expenses from all of the user’s employments](#employment-expenses)

### Employment details

Use these endpoints to maintain details of an employment:

<!---#### Off-payroll working rules--->

<!---Off-payroll working rules (IR35) govern how a worker (sometimes called a contractor) who is providing their services through an intermediary such as a personal service company, is treated in terms of their Income Tax and National Insurance. More information on off-payroll working rules can be found on the [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-off-payroll-working-ir35) website.--->

<!---The off-payroll worker status can be seen in-year as part of the employment pre-population into the customer’s self-assessment tax calculations. In software, the off-payroll working status is retrieved using the [Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BemploymentId%7D~1financial-details/get) endpoint. The status is also available in the [Retrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/ service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BcalculationId%7D/get) endpoint. This status is view-only: the customer does not need to take any action unless they think it has been set in error, in which case they must contact their employer.--->

<!---After the end of the tax year, the off-payroll working status will be displayed to the customer along with the employment data fields. As part of their self-assessment, if a customer agrees with their off-payroll working status, there is no further action required from them. However, if a customer disagrees with their off-payroll working status, they can change it after the end of tax year before completing their final declaration. This change can be made in software or through their HMRC online services account.--->

<!---The software must call the [Create and Amend Employment Financial Details](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BemploymentId%7D~1financial-details/put) endpoint to change the off-payroll working status. The following  warning message must be displayed to the customer:--->

<!--- “Do you want to change your employment details? You are about to change information [insert employer name] sent to HMRC: --->

<!--- * Off-payroll working status--->

<!--- HMRC may review this change.”--->

<!---As stated in the warning message, this action may be reviewed by HMRC.--->

### Pre-populated data

HMRC will pre-populate the employment information provided by employers. The user should check and correct the information, as necessary, prior to final declaration.

User-generated content:

* can be deleted

## Providing information about how to treat a loss

### Losses and claims

A self-employed business can have a loss when the trade expenses are more than the trade income.
If the business has a loss for a year prior to signing up to Making Tax Digital, the customer or agent will need to submit details of the loss to be brought forward.

<a href="figures/losses-api-diagram.svg" target="blank"><img src="figures/losses-api-diagram.svg" alt="Losses API calls" style="width:720px;" /></a>

<a href="figures/losses-api-diagram.svg" target="blank">Open the Losses diagram in a new tab</a>.

Vendors can use the [create a brought forward loss](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-losses-api/4.0/oas/page#tag/Brought-Forward-Losses/paths/~1individuals~1losses~1%7Bnino%7D~1brought-forward-losses/post) endpoint to enable customers to submit the brought forward loss to HMRC.

When the loss detail has been submitted, or if a loss arises for a tax year following sign up to Making Tax Digital, a claim will need to be made to either:

* utilise the loss against an income source for a specific year, or
* claim to carry the loss forward so that it is available to use in later years

The [Loss claims](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-losses-api/4.0/oas/page#tag/Loss-Claims) endpoint allows the user to do the following:

* provide a list of Loss claims
* create a Loss claim against an income source for a specific tax year
* show the detail of an existing Loss claim
* delete a previously entered Loss claim
* update a previously entered Loss claim

### Brought Forward Losses

These resources allow software packages to provide a customer's financial data for their brought forward losses. Here the developer can:

* provide a list of brought forward losses
* create a new brought forward loss to submit against self-employment, self-employment class 4, UK FHL property, other UK (non-FHL) property, foreign property FHL in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other foreign property
* show a single brought forward loss
* delete an existing brought forward loss
* update an existing brought forward loss

To carry-back a loss, the customer should contact HMRC who will be able to apply this manually.
