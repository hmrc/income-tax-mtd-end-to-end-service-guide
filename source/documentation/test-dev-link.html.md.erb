# Linking to API base pages and endpoints

## Creating a link to an API base page
Use the standard markdown coding. For example:

    [Test Fraud Prevention Headers API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/txm-fph-validator-api/)

Notice that the version number is intentionally omitted from the end of the URL. This results in the link automatically pointing to the latest version.

## Creating an anchor link to the latest version of an API endpoint
To create an anchor link, you need to do the following:

1. Rename the page, appending .erb. This is to indicate that the page contains embedded Ruby code.
2. Add the following link code to the page:

```
< % = make_a_link("api-name", "anchor-name", "Link text") % >
```
The anchor name is the ID of the anchor in the OAS document. The link text is the text that appears in the link.

The markup will contain a link to the most recent version of the api. Note that the anchor is all code after the # in the url.

Here's an example of the correctly rendered link code:
<%= make_a_link("individual-calculations-api", "trigger_a_self_assessment_tax_calculation", "Trigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation")  %>

For example, the [List All Businesses](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/1.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get) endpoint link uses this code:

    [List All Businesses](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/1.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get)

Notice the "business-details-api/1.0" embedded in the middle. This solution involves constructing the URL from the three building blocks, which you place within the "make_a_link" code. The "make_a_link" code then constructs the link with the version number always pointing to the latest version.


In this example: 

 - api-name = **business-details-api**
 - anchor-name = **/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get**
 - Link text = **List All Businesses**

So the link code you would add in this example is:

```
< % = make_a_link("business-details-api", "/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get", "List All Businesses")  % >
```

### Search and Replace Regular Expressions
To speed up the process of converting from markdown link coding to the anchor link coding, you can use the following search and replace regular expressions:

#### Search
    \[(.*)\]\((https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/)(.*\/)[0-9]+.[0-9]/oas/page#(.*?)\)

#### Replace
    < % = make_a_link("$3", "$4", "$1") % >
