# Sign up

## Agent

Before agents can sign up clients to Making Tax Digital they must:

* [Create an agent services account](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account)
* Have authorisation in place from their clients. Existing relationships can be copied from Self Assessment, or agents can ask for relationships for new clients. Both of these tasks can be done using their [agent services account](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sign-in-to-your-agent-services-account).

## Link software to HMRC

Businesses and agents using your software to connect to the [ITSA (MTD) API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-api/2.0) must grant authority to your software to interact with HMRC on their behalf. We use the open standard [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) (opens in a new tab), which involves the business or agent signing in via their Government Gateway account and following the grant authority user journey.

1.	Business or agent requests to link your software to HMRC.
2.	Your software launches the grant authority user journey.
3.	Business or agent views the HMRC start page for an overview of the process and chooses to continue.
4.	Business or agent signs in with their Government Gateway user ID and password (**agents must use their new agent services user ID**).
5.	Business or agent registers for or completes 2-step verification as applicable.
6.	Business or agent completes identity checks if applicable.
7.	Business or agent grants authority for the software to interact with HMRC on their behalf.
8.	HMRC generates an OAuth token for the business or agent.
9.	Your software stores the business or agentâ€™s OAuth token for later use in API calls on their behalf.

Business and agents authenticate directly with us using their Government Gateway user ID and password, and grant the software the authority to interact with HMRC on their behalf. They grant this for a set of functions called API scopes which are required for each ITSA (MTD) endpoint.

In the case of agents, they must sign in to their Government Gateway account with the user ID and password for their new agent services account, which was generated as part of the agent services account journey.

We then generate an OAuth 2.0 access token for the software which is specific to the business or agent. The software must pass this access token in subsequent API requests as explained in authorisation of user-restricted endpoints.
