# API lifecycle & deprecation

Each MTD API follows a lifecycle from the point where it is first published to the point where it is retired.

More specifically, every version of each API follows a lifecycle. Different versions of the same API can be at different points in the lifecycle. For example, v1.0 might be retired, v2.0 might be stable and v3.0 might be in beta.

## API status

The following table provides details about possible API statuses.

| Status | Meaning | Documentation visible? | Can be subscribed to in Developer Hub? | Endpoints enabled? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha| Early prototype - documentation only, available in External Test. Intended for feedback about the initial API design and documentation. Expect breaking changes and behaviour changes. | Yes | No | No |
| Beta | Live service but not stable. Breaking changes and behaviour changes are possible. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Stable | Stable live service. No breaking changes and only minor behaviour changes. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Deprecated | Set to be retired, either because a new version of the API is available or because the API is no longer supported. If applicable, a new version of the API will be available in external test when the current version is deprecated. | Yes | No | Yes |
| Retired | API is no longer in use. | No | No | No |

## Breaking changes

Any change that might break software that relies on an API is counted as breaking change.

The following table  lists changes that we consider breaking. 

| Area | Breaking changes |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Query Parameter | <ul><li>Adding mandatory query parameter</li><li>Removing a query parameter</li><li>Renaming a query parameter</li><li>Changing an optional query parameter to be mandatory</li><li>Removing/renaming a value from an enum</li></ul> |
| Request Body | <ul><li> Adding a mandatory field </li><li> Removing a field </li><li> Renaming a field </li><li> Changing an optional field to be mandatory </li><li> Removing/renaming a value from an enum</li></ul> |
| Response Body | <ul><li> Removing a field </li><li> Renaming a field </li><li> Changing a mandatory field to be optional </li><li> Adding/renaming a value to an enum</li></ul> |
| Other | <ul><li> Changing the URL of the endpoint </li><li> Removing a resource/endpoint </li><li> Changing the semantics of a field value (for example, the value returned changes from inclusive of VAT to exclusive of VAT) </li><li> Changing validation to have stronger constraints</li></ul> |

### Changes to errors

When we make changes to errors, we will not usually change the JSON structure returned. In the rare case when this is necessary, this will be considered a breaking change. The values of the error fields may change. 

The following table outlines which types of changes to errors are treated as breaking changes and which are not.

| Breaking changes for errors | Non-breaking changes for errors |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Changing the HTTP status code to a different value | Removing an error code |
| Renaming an error code | Changing the message of an error |
| Adding a new error code (but see below) |  |

If we add a new error code to an endpoint as part of a new field/object, which is not itself a breaking change, the new error is not counted as a breaking change.

For example, if we add a new optional string field to the request body and the field must satisfy a specific condition (otherwise, it fails with a new error), this error is not considered a breaking change because existing software will keep functioning as the error can be returned only if the new field is used.

## Deprecating APIs

If an API has been in production with a status of 'Stable', we aim for a deprecation period of 6 months. 

For an API in beta, we aim for a deprecation period of 6 weeks minimum.

Applications cannot subscribe to a deprecated API version, but can still call the API version if the subscription was made before the status changed.

The status of APIs is indicated in the API documentation. 

## Indicating deprecation in headers

For releases after January 2024, when an endpoint becomes deprecated, it will return the following response headers.

| Name | Meaning | Example value |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| Deprecation | The deprecation date/time for this endpoint, in IMF-fixdate format. | Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:59:59 GMT |
| Sunset | (optional) The earliest date/time this endpoint will become unavailable after deprecation, in IMF-fixdate format. | Sun, 02 Jul 2023 23:59:59 GMT |
| Link | Documentation URL for the relevant API | https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api |

The 'Sunset' header contains the earliest date/time that the endpoint could be retired after being deprecated. Do not rely on the availability of the endpoint after this.

The 'Sunset' header may not be returned in some rare cases, such as when the retirement date for an endpoint is uncertain.

### Older deprecation headers

In previous releases, deprecation status could be indicated with a 'Deprecation' response header like this.

| Name | Example value |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Deprecation | This endpoint is deprecated. See the [API documentation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-bsas-api/). |

**Note:** This was implemented only for the Business Source Adjustable Summary API.

## Retiring APIs

After an API has been deprecated for the amounts of time indicated above, it can be retired and the endpoints and documentation will be removed. Ensure that your application does not rely on any deprecated APIs.
