# Penalties and appeals

## Penalties for late payment and late submission

The way that HMRC penalises ITSA late payments and late submissions will be changing. The changes, referred to as 'Penalty Reform for ITSA', will apply to ITSA customers from the tax year in which they become mandated to join MTD. More information will follow as it is made available.

For tax years prior to the changes, the existing late payment and late filing penalties continue to apply. You can find more information about these penalties on gov.uk:

- [Penalties for late filing of Self Assessment tax returns](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties)
- [Self Assessment: how to appeal against penalties for late filing and late payment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-appeal-against-penalties-for-late-filing-and-late-payment-sa370/self-assessment-how-to-appeal-against-penalties-for-late-filing-and-late-payment)

## Other penalties

Other penalties that apply to ITSA customers are unchanged by Penalty Reform and will continue to be charged where appropriate. These include:

- [Inaccuracy penalties - Factsheet CC/FS7a](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-inaccuracies-in-returns-or-documents-ccfs7a)
- [Penalties for not telling HMRC about an under-assessment - Factsheet CC/FS7b](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-not-telling-hmrc-about-an-under-assessment-ccfs7b)
- [Penalties for failure to notify HMRC of a liability to tax - Factsheet CC/FS11](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-failure-to-notify-ccfs11)

## Paying penalties and interest

Penalties must be paid within 30 days of the date on the penalty notice. Late payment interest will be charged on penalties that are not paid on time.

## Appeals

The [existing process for appeals](https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals/penalty) will remain in place, although a provision will be made as part of Penalty Reform to allow the user to appeal their late submission and late payment penalties through the digital tax account.

A customer or agent may contact HMRC if they have a query about a tax decision. If they don’t understand the decision they can also get advice from HMRC or professional help.
