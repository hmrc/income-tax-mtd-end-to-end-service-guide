# Online Business Tax Account

## Make a change of circumstances

Functionality within the Business Tax Account will allow businesses to update their ‘change of circumstances’, until then they should call the HMRC helpline about a change of circumstances.
When the online functionality is delivered, vendors should present messages to business users regularly to remind them to check and update their details with HMRC.
Business users will then be able to do that by visiting their Business Tax Account at:

[https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds](https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds)

Businesses will be able to update a range of information, including addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail and business type.

### Agent able to notify their own change of circumstances

This will initially be the usual process, which can be used to remove the agent reference number and Government Gateway (GGW) enrolment (HMRC-AS-AGENTS).
The scenario is needed where an agency firm ceases trading.
If an agent no longer wants to participate in MTD they can stop using their GGW ID.
An online interface is being developed as part of the wider change of circumstances solution.

## View Future obligations or previous returns in BTA

Some customers may wish to view information regarding their income tax for assurance purposes, this may also include any previous updates that have been submitted.

Vendors should make available within software products as many suitable features as possible to meet user needs.

Vendors can direct users to visit their [Business Tax Account](https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds) to view certain information.

A customer who has signed up for MTD and agreed to report using software, can choose to sign into their Business Tax Account and view information such as obligation periods, year-to-date and income tax calculations.
User research will continue, and further iterations will be made which will enhance the functionality of the Business Tax Account and help to improve user experience.

Future features will also enable customers to have a statement view, make a change of to their business information, along with links to make a card payments.

The Business Tax Account displays the following information:

* reporting obligations, and their status, per income source
* tax estimates
* year-to-date income tax calculation
