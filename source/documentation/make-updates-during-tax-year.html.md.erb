# Making updates during the tax year

## Making Tax Digital for Income Tax mandated income

A customer’s Making Tax Digital for Income Tax mandated income consists of the following:

- self-employed sole trader income
- property income

This is the ‘qualifying’ income HMRC uses to establish if the customer meets the criteria for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax. Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Customers can have one, or multiple, businesses with these types of income. For more information about qualifying income, refer to [Check what is included in your qualifying income (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-youre-eligible-for-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax#check-what-is-included-in-your-qualifying-income).

### Self-employed sole trader income

If the customer is working for themselves, they are a sole trader. For more information about identifying self-employed sole traders, refer to [Working for yourself (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/working-for-yourself?step-by-step-nav=01ff8dbd-886a-4dbb-872c-d2092b31b2cf). Currently, self-employment income refers to sole trader self-employment income and not income earned through partnerships. This exclusion also applies to directors of limited companies.

### Property income

A customer’s property income includes the following:

- rental income and other receipts from UK land or property
- rental income and other receipts from foreign land or property
- income from letting furnished rooms in customer’s own home
- income from furnished holiday lettings (FHL) and non-furnished holiday lettings (non-FHL) in the UK
- premiums from leasing UK land
- inducements to take an interest in letting a property (a reverse premium)

## Showing customers their obligations

A Making Tax Digital for Income Tax mandated or voluntary customer will have a set of obligations for each tax year. These are:

- 4 quarterly updates
- final declaration 

At any time of the year, customers can check their obligations. To provide this information, the software needs details about their business income sources. It gets this information by using the [List All Businesses](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get) endpoint, which provides the business ID. This ID is required to call multiple self-employment and property endpoints. To save time, the software should store this ID instead of making extra calls.

Quarterly obligations are created for sole trader and property income sources. In software, the retrieval of customer’s obligations is done by calling any of the following endpoints depending on the customer’s type of income source:

- [Retrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) Income and Expenditure Obligations](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/obligations-api/3.0/oas/page#/paths/~1obligations~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1income-and-expenditure/get)
- [Retrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) Final Declaration Obligations](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/obligations-api/3.0/oas/page#/paths/~1obligations~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1crystallisation/get)

These endpoints provide obligation dates for all self-employment and property businesses, and inform whether or not obligations have been met. The deadline for meeting a quarterly obligation is one month after the obligation period end date. The software should communicate these deadlines clearly to the customer and prompt them to submit the information when the update is due. 

After submitting a quarterly update or a final declaration, it may take up to an hour for the obligation to be marked as fulfilled in HMRC's system. 

A customer should always be able to view their latest obligations. To do this, the software should be aware that the customer’s obligation will be created or updated for the following reasons:

- start of financial year
- when a customer submits updates
- when a customer adds a new sole trader business in [HMRC online services](/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services)
- when a customer ceases an existing business in HMRC online services

## Change to calendar quarters

From the tax year 2024 to 2025, accounting periods that run from 1 April to 31 March will be treated as equivalent to 6 April to 5 April. This removes the need for customers to make small adjustments of a few days to determine their profit or loss for the tax year.

As a result, customers with an accounting period that starts on 1 April (rather than 6 April) and ends on 31 March will have the opportunity to change their quarterly updates to also start at the beginning of the month. Although all Making Tax Digital for Income Tax customers or their agents will be able to make this change through their software regardless of their accounting period, only customers with accounting periods starting on 1 April will benefit. Consequently, the software must avoid allowing customers with accounting periods other than 1 April to 31 March to make this change.

The following table shows an example.

| Quarterly update | Calendar quarterly period |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1                | 1 April to 30 June        |
| 2                | 1 July to 30 September    |
| 3                | 1 October to 31 December  |
| 4                | 1 January to 31 March     |

By default, a customer’s quarterly updates will be set automatically to standard quarters. If they wish to change to calendar quarterly updates, they must do this through their software. This cannot be done through HMRC online services. The software must make this option available to customers before they submit their first quarterly update. This is because after submitting the first quarterly update for a tax year, the customer cannot change the quarters for that tax year.

However, if the customer is signing up to Making Tax Digital for Income Tax late in the tax year, they can still make this change as long as it is before their first quarterly update. This change will have no effect on the update deadlines.

To allow a customer to change their periods to calendar quarters, the software should use the [Create and Amend Quarterly Period Type for a Business](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1{nino}~1{businessId}~1{taxYear}/put) endpoint. The software should use the [Obligations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/obligations-api/) to access the new calendar quarterly periods. 

For those customers who took part in MTD from April 2025 and chose to send calendar quarterly updates, the first quarterly period starts on 6 April and ends on 30 June. As a result, customers with a 1 April to 31 March accounting period will need to ensure that income and expenses for the period from 1 April to 5 April are also submitted so that their liability can be assessed accurately for the full tax year equivalent period.

Consider the following example:

- the customer uses their software to make the change to calendar quarters before their first quarterly update - in software, this is done by using the [Create and Amend Quarterly Period Type for a Business](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1{nino}~1{businessId}~1{taxYear}/put) endpoint
- the software then calls the [Obligations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/obligations-api/) , which shows the customer’s new calendar quarterly updates as follows

    | Quarterly update | Calendar quarterly period |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
    | 1                | 6 April to 30 June        |
    | 2                | 1 July to 30 September    |
    | 3                | 1 October to 31 December  |
    | 4                | 1 January to 31 March     |

- the change affects the first period of the first year and starts from 6 April because that is the first day of the tax year - the first period for subsequent tax years starts on 1 April 
- the customer uses the steps described in [Submit quarterly update](#submit-quarterly-update) to submit their calendar quarterly updates through their software
- when all calendar quarterly updates have been made, the customer needs to account for the income and expense information for the period to 5 April - they can do this through their software by using the [Business Source Adjustable Summary API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-bsas-api/)

After the calendar quarterly election change has been made, it will continue year on year until the customer requests a change back to standard quarterly updates. The software can use the [Create and Amend Quarterly Period Type for a Business](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1{nino}~1{businessId}~1{taxYear}/put) endpoint to allow a customer to change their periods back to standard quarters. Each year the customer makes these changes, the first period start date will be affected and will reflect the previous quarterly update type.

## How to submit and view in-year updates after tax year 2025

Making Tax Digital for Income Tax mandated and voluntary customers must create and keep digital records of their self-employment and property business income and expenses. They must then submit summary totals of the information in their digital records to HMRC every quarter.  If they wish, they can also submit this summary-level information more frequently, for example, monthly.

Customers are required to submit each quarterly update by the relevant quarterly due date to avoid receiving a late submission penalty point. If a customer misses the deadline for the first quarterly update, such as by 7th August, they can still submit the second quarterly update by 7th November. The second update will satisfy the obligations for both Q1 and Q2. However, the customer may incur a penalty point for not submitting the first quarterly update on time. 

Customers must submit at least one update for each quarter. The following table shows an example:

| Update    | Quarter(s)   | Result    |
|---  |---  |---  |
| 1   | 1   | 6 April to 5 July is accepted  |
| 2   | 2   | 6 April to 5 October is accepted  |
| 3   | 3, 4   | 6 April to 5 April is accepted with a possible penalty    |

### Foreign property income

Customers must report their rental income and other receipts from foreign land or property through their Making Tax Digital Software. To ensure the correct tax is calculated software must ensure the customer creates a unique property ID for each property within the foreign country. This must still be completed if only one property is applicable.

Software will use the [Create Foreign Property Details](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/property-business-api/6.0/oas/page#tag/Foreign-Property-Details/paths/~1individuals~1business~1property~1foreign~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BbusinessId%7D~1details~1%7BtaxYear%7D/post) endpoint with a property name provided by the customer to retrieve a unique property ID from HMRC for each foreign property. 

Software will use the business ID and the property ID when submitting quarterly updates through the [Create and Amend a Foreign Property Cumulative Period Summary](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/property-business-api/6.0/oas/page#tag/Income-and-Expenses-Period-Summaries/paths/~1individuals~1business~1property~1foreign~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BbusinessId%7D~1cumulative~1%7BtaxYear%7D/put) endpoint. 

To remove a foreign property, software can provide an end date for income from that property at any time during the tax year using the [Update Foreign Property Details](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/property-business-api/6.0/oas/page#tag/Foreign-Property-Details/paths/~1individuals~1business~1property~1foreign~1%7Bnino%7D~1details~1%7BpropId%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D/put) endpoint.

<a href="figures/foreign-property-income.svg" target="blank">Open the end-to-end journey diagram in a new tab</a>.

1. The customer needs to report foreign property rental income.
2. Software submits propertyName and countryCode.
3. HMRC stores this information and creates a unique propertyID. 
4. Software retrieves the propertyID.
5. If multiple properties exist, then the process is repeated for each one.
6. Customer wants to submit their foreign property quarterly update.
7. Software submits the propertyID along with the income and expense information using the [Create and Amend a Foreign Property Cumulative Period Summary](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/property-business-api/6.0/oas/page#tag/Income-and-Expenses-Period-Summaries/paths/~1individuals~1business~1property~1foreign~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BbusinessId%7D~1cumulative~1%7BtaxYear%7D/put) endpoint.
8. HMRC accepts the submission.

### Submit and amend quarterly update

The software should convert transactional information into summary totals. It should send this summary information to HMRC for each self-employment and property income source. HMRC can then use this information to calculate business profits based on the most recent data.

Customers with an annual turnover (sales) of less than £90,000 can report their total income and expenses in their quarterly updates (no further breakdown required). They can do this through the software by using the ‘Consolidated Expenses’ parameter in [Self-Employment Business](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-employment-business-api/) and [Property Business](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/property-business-api/) for both self-employment and property income.

If a customer submits updates more frequently, their quarterly obligations are met when they make an update with an end date equal to or greater than the obligation period end date. For example, if a customer submits their standard quarterly updates for the following dates, then the last submission, shown below, would fulfil the Q1 obligation.

- 6 April to 30 April
- 6 April to 31 May
- 6 April to 30 June
- 6 April to 31 July: Q1 fulfilled

If a customer wants to make a change to a previously submitted periodic update, they can include that change in their following update. Each update invalidates the previous submission because all periods start from 6 April thus software should follow the same journey for creating and amending a quarterly update.
