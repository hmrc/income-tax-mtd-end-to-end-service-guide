## Overview

### What is HMRC Assist

As part of Making Tax Digital, HMRC Assist is a set of APIs that will create a better customer experience by prompting customers with help via software they use when submitting quarterly updates.

HMRC Assist will provide guidance and links encouraging customers to get their tax affairs right the first time.  

It will allow customers to:

* correct and understand entitlements and reliefs allowable
* have predictable tax bills
* a better cashflow
