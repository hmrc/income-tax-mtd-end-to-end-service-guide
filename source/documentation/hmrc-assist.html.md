# HMRC Assist
<!--- Section owner: Transactional Risking --->

As part of Making Tax Digital, HMRC Assist is a set of APIs that will create a better customer experience by prompting customers with help through their software when they make the following tax calculations: 

- in-year to date
- in-year forecast
- end-of-year

HMRC Assist is a new digital service for customers who have signed up for Making Tax Digital ITSA. It will provide targeted and tailored messaging to support individual customers with their tax affairs. Agents acting on behalf of clients will receive the same service when they request a tax calculation.

The service will encourage customers to submit accurate information using personalised real-time guidance, increasing correct first-time submissions and compliance.

The service will take the calculation data of the customer, analyse the submission and generate a series of guidance materials, links and suggested actions for the customer to review. 

HMRC Assist will be integrated into HMRCâ€™s ITSA Submission Service so that customers completing their final declaration or return amendment using HMRC online services will receive tailored assistance.
