# Marriage Allowance

Marriage Allowance allows the user to transfer £1,260 of their Personal Allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner.

This reduces the recipient’s tax by up to £252 in the tax year (6 April to 5 April the next year).

To create a Marriage Allowance claim the recipients name, date of birth and NINO must be provided.

Use the Create Marriage Allowance endpoint in the Individuals Disclosures API.
