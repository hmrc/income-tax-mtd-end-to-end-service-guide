# Additional Information

If MTD customers are earning any type of income in addition to their self-employment and property income, they must report that to HMRC just as they would in their Self Assessment return. 

The software should prompt customers to provide details about any additional income sources. If the software does not support submission of any applicable additional income, customers must use [HMRC online services](/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/online-tax-account.html#hmrc-online-services) to make their submission. For more information about which type of income to tell HMRC, refer to [Check if you need to tell HMRC about additional income (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/check-additional-income-tax). 

Customers who need to submit their additional income must do it before submitting their final declaration. The following sections cover the different types of additional income and the endpoints needed to submit them in the software. 

## Employments

A customer will have employment income if they work for an employer who deducts tax from their pay through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). A customer's earnings and tax deducted are sent to HMRC by their employer. This allows HMRC to hold an employment history for each customer. HMRC uses this information to calculate whether the correct PAYE tax has been paid at the end of the tax year. For more information about declaring employment income, refer to [Self Assessment: Employment (GOV.UK).](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102)

Currently, under Self Assessment, a customer will see their PAYE earnings, tax deducted and other financial details pre-populated in their online tax return. They can overwrite any information that might be incorrect. 

Customers can continue to do this under Making Tax Digital (MTD). They can:

- view employment details (financial and non-financial) held by HMRC throughout the year
- create and amend employment details submitted by them after the end of the tax year
- delete employment details submitted by them after the end of the tax year

### View employment details

The following endpoints enables the customer to view different types of employment details:

- [List Employments](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get)
- [Retrieve an Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}/get)
- [Retrieve Other Employment Income](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get)
- [Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/get)

A customer, at any time, can view a list of their employers for a specific tax year. The [List Employments](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get) endpoint provides the software with the Employment IDs for each customer employment. This Employment ID is necessary to call other employment income endpoints.

The software can use the [Retrieve an Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}/get) endpoint to enable the customer to view non-financial details about a specific employment for a given tax year. This includes the start date of the employment and employer name.

The software can use the [Retrieve Other Employment Income](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get) endpoint to enable the customer to view other employment income details for a given year. This includes share options, shares awarded or received, disability, lump sums and foreign service income.

Employers will also submit financial details that form the customers earnings and deductions. In software, this information can be viewed using the [Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/get) endpoint. The endpoint contains details on taxable pay to date, [benefits in kind](https://www.gov.uk/tax-company-benefits), student loan deductions and the customer's off payroll working status for a specific employment.

#### Off-payroll working (OPW) rules

Off-payroll working rules (IR35) govern how a worker (sometimes called a contractor) who is providing their services through an intermediary such as a personal service company, is treated in terms of their Income Tax and National Insurance. More information on off-payroll working rules can be found on the [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-off-payroll-working-ir35) website.

The off-payroll worker status can be seen in-year as part of the employment pre-population into the customer’s self-assessment tax calculations. In software, the off-payroll working status is retrieved using the [Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BemploymentId%7D~1financial-details/get) endpoint. The status is also available in the [Retrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation](/api-documentation/docs/api/ service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BcalculationId%7D/get) endpoint. If the status is set to false, indicating the worker is not regarded as being subject to OPW rules, the software should not display it to the customer. This status is view-only: the customer does not need to take any action unless they think it has been set in error, in which case they must contact their employer.

After the end of the tax year, the off-payroll working status will be displayed to the customer along with the employment data fields. As part of their self-assessment, if a customer agrees with their off-payroll working status, there is no further action required from them. However, if a customer disagrees with their off-payroll working status, they can change it after the end of tax year before completing their final declaration. This change can be made in software or through their HMRC online services account. The software must call the [Create and Amend Employment Financial Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BemploymentId%7D~1financial-details/put) endpoint to change the off-payroll working status. 

The following  warning message must be displayed to the customer:

> “Do you want to change your employment details? You are about to change information [insert employer name] sent to HMRC:

> * Off-payroll working status

> HMRC may review this change.”

As stated in the warning message, this action may be reviewed by HMRC.

### Create and Amend employment details

The following endpoints enable the customer to create and amend different types of employment details:

- [Add a Custom Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/post)
- [Amend a Custom Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}/put)
- [Create and Amend Employment Financial Details ](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/put)
- [Create and Amend Other Employment Income](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/put)

At the end of the tax year, if the customer thinks an employment is missing in data held by HMRC, they can add it. In software, this is done by calling the [Add a Custom Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/post) endpoint. After adding an employment, the customer needs to add the appropriate financial details for that employment. In software, this is done by calling the [Create and Amend Employment Financial Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/put) endpoint. 

If a customer thinks that the financial details are incorrect for an employer in data held by HMRC, they can update it using the same endpoint. If the customer also thinks their non-financial details or other employment details are inaccurate, they can amend it. In software, this is done by calling the [Amend a Custom Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}/put) or [Create and Amend Other Employment Income](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/put) endpoint respectively.

### Delete employment details

The following endpoints allow the customer to delete different types of employment details:

If a customer has incorrect employment details, they can delete them. This can be done only at the end of the tax year. In the software, this is done by calling the [Delete Employment Financial Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/delete) or [Delete Other Employment Income](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/delete) endpoint, depending on the detail type.

For some incorrect employment details held by HMRC, the customer can ask HMRC to ignore this information. In software, this is done by calling the [Ignore Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1ignore/post) endpoint. This action can be reversed by using the [Unignore Employment](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1unignore/post) endpoint.

## Providing information about how to treat a loss

A self-employed business can have a loss when trade expenses are more than trade income. If the business has a loss for a year before signing up to Making Tax Digital, the customer or agent will need to submit details about the loss to be brought forward. For more information, refer to [HS227 Losses (GOV.UK).](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/losses-hs227-self-assessment-helpsheet/hs227-losses-2023#using-losses-types-of-claim)

Customers can submit different types of losses through their software. This includes brought forward losses and capital gains losses. Brought forward losses can be calculated for the customer’s self-employment, UK property, and foreign property business income types. The software can use the following endpoints to enable customers to:

- [Create a brought forward loss](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-losses-api/4.0/oas/page#tag/Brought-Forward-Losses/paths/~1individuals~1losses~1{nino}~1brought-forward-losses/post)

## Capital Gains Tax

Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit when someone sells or disposes of an asset that has increased in value. Customers may need to report on the following types of asset:

* residential property
* other property 
* listed and unlisted shares and securities 

For more information on capital gains tax, see [Capital Gains Tax: what you pay it on, rates and allowances](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax).

MTD customers can also report any losses they have made. This charge may be set against earlier or later years. When the customer sells or disposes of the whole or part of a UK residential property and is liable to pay CGT, they must tell HMRC within a specific time following the date of completion of the sale. For more information on the reporting requirement, see [Report and pay your Capital Gains Tax: If you sold a property in the UK on or after 6 April 2020](https://www.gov.uk/report-and-pay-your-capital-gains-tax/if-you-sold-a-property-in-the-uk-on-or-after-6-april-2020). For non-resident customers, see [Tell HMRC about Capital Gains Tax on UK property or land if you’re not a UK resident](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-gains-tax-for-non-residents-uk-residential-property), which advises on how these gains must be reported in year.

The customer can create, update, or delete their capital gains tax in software only after the end of the tax year. If they need to make changes during the year, they need to use HMRC online services. In some cases, customers must report and pay before they submit their final declaration. However, this information will still need to be included in their final declaration if they are a Self Assessment or MTD customer.

An MTD customer can do the following: 

* view CGT Residential Property Disposals for PPD, non-PPD and other capital gains and disposals
* create or amend CGT Residential Property Disposals for PPD, non-PPD and other capital gains and disposals
* delete CGT Residential Property Disposals for PPD, non-PPD and other capital gains and disposals

### Viewing CGT

At any time, a customer can view their capital gains tax information. In software, this information is retrieved using the following endpoints:

* [Retrieve All CGT Residential Property Disposals and Overrides (Includes PPD and Non-PPD)](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Capital-Gains-on-Residential-Property-Disposals/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1disposals~1residential-property~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D/get)

### Creating or Amending CGT

Customers can create or amend the different types of CGT information after the end of the tax year. This change must be done before they submit their final declaration. In software, this information is updated using the following endpoints:

* [Create and Amend ‘Report and Pay Capital Gains Tax on Property’ Overrides](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Capital-Gains-on-Residential-Property-Disposals/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1disposals~1residential-property~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1ppd/put)

### Deleting CGT

Customers can delete different types of CGT only after the end of the tax year and only after they have created CGT using software. However, this change must be done before they submit their final declaration.  In software, this deletion is made using the following endpoints:

* [Delete ‘Report and Pay Capital Gains Tax on Residential Property’ Overrides](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Capital-Gains-on-Residential-Property-Disposals/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1disposals~1residential-property~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1ppd/delete)

## Marriage Allowance

Marriage Allowance allows the customer to transfer some of their Personal Allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner. This will reduce the customer's tax in the next tax year (6 April to 5 April). For more information about marriage allowance, refer to [Marriage Allowance: How it works - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance).

Customers can create a Marriage Allowance claim using their name, date of birth and NINO. To do this action, the software must call the [Create Marriage Allowance](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-disclosures-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Marriage-Allowance/paths/~1individuals~1disclosures~1marriage-allowance~1{nino}/post) endpoint in the [Individuals Disclosures API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-disclosures-api/). After the claim has been accepted by HMRC, the customer can view their Marriage Allowance in their tax calculations.
